# Project coding standards for this project

Guidelines to follow at all times:
- Always keep your changes limited to what explicitly mentioned
- Don't use any 3rd party libraries/framework/code unless explicitly requested
- Focus on simplicity both in terms of design/architecture and implementation
- Code has to be easy to reason about, and easy to extend/change in the future
- Validate that you understand the question correctly by re-iterating what's asked of you but with different words
- Double-check your work before responding, think outside the box and consider tradeoffs and pros/cons.
- Consider how maintainable your changes will be, always try to create as maintainable code as possible
- Take a step back if needed and retry if you can think of a better solution
- Simple is better than complicated
- All code should be treated as production code
- Don't add any comments unless the next line is really complicated and hard to understand
- Don't create new abstractions unless absolutely required for fulfilling what's outlined above
- Most important, try to write simple and easily understood code
- For particularly tricky/large changes, divide your work into multiple milestones, and work through them one by one, and since you have a limit how big single commits can be, make sure to make multiple commits instead of one large one.
